# blue_sky6: Weather Dashboard

## Description

For blue sky, the first step is to enter the name of the city. After the city has been searched, blue sky will presented you with the current forecast of that city and right under will be the next five days.
If the individual would like to search another city, they would type a different city name in the search box and it will come up. You will see the the website will remember the previous city that was searched, right under the search box.

The main motivation for this project was to find the forecast of the city of my choice. I learned better use of JavaScript, API's, and jQuery.

The blue_sky weather website was created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API's, and jQuery.
